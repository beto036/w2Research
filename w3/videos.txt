Android Libraries
The video explains some libraries that we can use when developing a new app. The speaker talks about Butter Knife, Gson, Picasso, Retrofit, Dart and Hanson. 
These are very handy libraries and you can use them all together. You can save a lot of coding lines and do a lot of things and improve the performance all 
along the way. Butter Knife helps you to avoid writing findById millions of times. Gson helps you to convert JSON to Java Objects and vice versa. Retrofit 
allows you to make http calls synchronously and asynchronously and work whit GSON and Picasso at the same time. Finally you have Dart and Hanson which help you
to start an activity with extras without calling the put extras method. Great!

Dependendy Injection
The speaker talks about dependency injection which let you use dependencies that was already created when you are runnig your app. He talked about Dagger
that is a library that allows you to use dependency injection in android using annotated classes. He didn't explained so much about using it in android but
gave you a very useful general view on how does it works. Injection dependency improves the performance of the app because you already have the instances created.
