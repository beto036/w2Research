setRetainInstance
Control whether a fragment instance is retained across Activity re-creation (such as from a configuration change). 
This can only be used with fragments not in the back stack. 
If set, the fragment lifecycle will be slightly different when an activity is recreated:

- onDestroy() will not be called (but onDetach() still will be, because the fragment is being detached from its current activity).
- onCreate(Bundle) will not be called since the fragment is not being re-created.
- onAttach(Activity) and onActivityCreated(Bundle) will still be called.

getChildFragmentManager()
Return a private FragmentManager for placing and managing Fragments inside of this Fragment.
